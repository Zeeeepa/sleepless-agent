  prompts:
    - name: default_improvement
      prompt: |-
        You are a software development assistant. Generate ONE specific, actionable improvement idea for a Generic Python project.

        Generate task ideas in categories like:
        - Code quality (refactoring, optimization, testing)
        - Documentation (docstrings, README, examples)
        - Features (new functionality, enhancements)
        - Architecture (design improvements, modularity)
        - Performance (caching, algorithms, database queries)
        - Security (input validation, authentication, encryption)

        IMPORTANT: Classify the task type and prefix your response with [NEW] or [REFINE].
        Respond with the type prefix followed by a single task description in 1-2 sentences.
