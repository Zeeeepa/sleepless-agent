        The workspace has multiple ongoing projects and tasks that need attention.

        ## Current State
        - Active tasks: {task_count} ({pending_count} pending, {in_progress_count} in progress)
        - Many tasks are already in progress or pending

        ## Available Tasks to Refine
        {available_tasks}

        ## Recent Work & Context
        {recent_work}

        ## Workspace Constraints
        - Tasks execute in isolated directories: workspace/tasks/<task_id>/
        - Each task only has access to its own workspace folder and workspace/shared/
        - Do NOT reference workspace/data/ or other system directories in task descriptions
        - REFINE tasks reuse existing task workspaces (no new folder created)

        ## Task Generation
        Generate ONE REFINE task to continue or improve existing work:
        - Complete partial/incomplete tasks mentioned above
        - Follow up on outstanding items and recommendations
        - Enhance or improve existing projects in the workspace
        - Fix issues or improve quality of current work
        - Add missing components to existing implementations
        - Expand documentation or analysis from previous tasks

        IMPORTANT Format Requirements:
        - To refine a specific task: Use [REFINE:#<task_id>] followed by description
          Example: [REFINE:#2] Improve error handling and add edge case tests
        - For general refinements: Use [REFINE] followed by description
        - Your response MUST be 1-2 sentences max

        Focus on completing or improving what already exists rather than starting new projects.

        Review the workspace state and generate a valuable task.

        ## Current State
        - Active tasks: {task_count} ({pending_count} pending, {in_progress_count} in progress)

        ## Available Tasks to Refine

        ## Workspace Constraints
        - Tasks execute in isolated directories: workspace/tasks/<task_id>/
        - Each task only has access to its own workspace folder and workspace/shared/
        - Do NOT reference workspace/data/ or other system directories in task descriptions
        - REFINE tasks reuse existing task workspaces (no new folder created)

        ## Task Generation
        Generate ONE valuable task (NEW or REFINE):
        - For REFINE: improve existing work, complete partial tasks, enhance current projects
        - For NEW: create something useful, interesting, or educational

        Task categories to consider:
        - Software development (applications, scripts, tools, APIs)
        - Data analysis and visualization projects
        - Research and documentation (technical guides, comparisons, best practices)
        - Creative writing (stories, tutorials, technical articles)
        - System design and architecture documents
        - Educational content and examples
        - Automation and productivity improvements
        - Analysis and evaluation reports

        IMPORTANT Format Requirements:
        - To refine a specific task: Use [REFINE:#<task_id>] followed by description
          Example: [REFINE:#1] Add comprehensive testing suite with edge cases
        - For general refinements: Use [REFINE] followed by description
        - For new tasks: Use [NEW] followed by description
        - Your response MUST be 1-2 sentences max

        Generate an interesting and valuable task for the workspace.

        ## Current State
        - Active tasks: {task_count} ({pending_count} pending, {in_progress_count} in progress)
        - Few tasks in queue - good time for new projects!

        ## Available Tasks to Refine
        {available_tasks}

        ## Workspace Constraints
        - Tasks execute in isolated directories: workspace/tasks/<task_id>/
        - Each task only has access to its own workspace folder and workspace/shared/
        - Do NOT reference workspace/data/ or other system directories in task descriptions
        - REFINE tasks reuse existing task workspaces (no new folder created)

        ## Task Generation
        Generate ONE innovative task that creates value.

        Areas to explore:
        - Build practical tools and utilities
        - Create educational content and tutorials
        - Develop software applications or scripts
        - Write comprehensive documentation or guides
        - Design systems and architectures
        - Analyze and compare technologies or approaches
        - Generate creative content (technical writing, examples)
        - Research and summarize complex topics
        - Create data visualizations or analysis
        - Develop proof-of-concepts or experiments

        Can be NEW (fresh project) or REFINE (improve existing work) - choose what would be most valuable.

        IMPORTANT Format Requirements:
        - To refine a specific task: Use [REFINE:#<task_id>] followed by description
          Example: [REFINE:#3] Expand analysis with performance benchmarks
        - For general refinements: Use [REFINE] followed by description
        - For new tasks: Use [NEW] followed by description
        - Your response MUST be 1-2 sentences max
