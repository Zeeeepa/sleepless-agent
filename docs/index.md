# Sleepless Agent Documentation

Welcome to the Sleepless Agent documentation! This guide will help you understand, configure, and use the 24/7 AI agent that works while you sleep.

## What is Sleepless Agent?

Sleepless Agent is an autonomous AI system that transforms your Claude Code Pro subscription into a 24/7 AgentOS. It processes tasks via Slack commands, manages isolated workspaces, and optimizes Claude usage across day and night cycles.
